# Zynx

Zynx (**Zy**gote **N**e**x**us) is a dynamic code injection framework for Android, written in Rust. It uses eBPF for kernel-level process monitoring and ptrace for runtime injection, loading custom code into app processes during initialization.

## Features

- **eBPF-based process monitoring** — efficiently tracks Zygote fork events in kernel space
- **Ptrace-driven injection** — injects code into app processes at the `SpecializeCommon` stage
- **Stealthy** — traceless operation with no mounts; non-target processes are left completely untouched
- **Policy framework** — determines per-app injection decisions with async two-phase checks

## Usage

### LiteLoader

Place shared libraries (`.so`) or dex files (`.dex`) in `/data/adb/zynx/liteloader/` with the naming convention `<package_name>-<library_name>.(so|dex)`. They will be automatically loaded into the target app process.

### Force Debuggable

> Requires `--cfg-enable-debugger` to be enabled.

Set the system property `debug.zynx.debuggable.<package_name>` to `1` to force-enable debugging for the specified app:

```shell
setprop debug.zynx.debuggable.com.example.app 1
```

### Zygisk (WIP)

> Requires `--cfg-enable-zygisk` to be enabled.

Enables Zygisk compatibility layer, allowing Zynx to load Zygisk modules.
